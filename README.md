# Github Contribution Statistics

This is a simple TypeScript/React script for a raycast extension, that fetches the contribution statistics of a given GitHub user. I want to keep myself motivated contributing everyday. Since i am a victim to simple Duolingo / Snapchat Streaks i thought this concept could also be applied to my contributing behaviour.
